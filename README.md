Creative Portion:

We implemented a chat alert system where the owner/creator of a chat can send an alert to everyone currently on his chat! This gives the 
chat owner more moderator privileges as he can alert his current chat users of things at anytime.

We also implemented a function where owners/creators of a chat can grant moderator privileges to other usernames for that specific chat. Whoever the owner decides to grant priveleges to for a certain chat will also gain access to kicking, banning, alerting, and privelege granting for that specific chat.
